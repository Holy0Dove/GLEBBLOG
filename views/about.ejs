Here, you'll get to know a little bit more about me, the brains behind this page. </br>

<h3>Who am I? </h3> 
no my name not Gleb it was joke. my real name is Oleg. <br>
I'm a <s>little</s> <s>shy</s> passionate Backend Developer with a keen interest in creating robust and efficient server-side applications.<br>
 While my primary focus is on the backend, I also possess a decent understanding of frontend development, <br>
 allowing me to bridge the gap between the server and client sides of applications.
<h3>
What makes me tick? </h3>
I thrive on solving complex problems and crafting elegant solutions that enhance user experiences.<br> 
Whether it's architecting scalable systems, optimizing database queries, or designing RESTful APIs, I'm always up for the challenge.

<h3>Why am I here?</h3> I believe in the power of technology to drive positive change, and I'm committed to contributing my skills and knowledge to build innovative solutions that make a difference. 
<br>
Through continuous learning and collaboration,<br> I strive to stay ahead of the curve and deliver exceptional results.

<h3>What sets me apart?</h3> Besides my technical skills, I bring a creative flair and a strong attention to detail to everything I do.
<br> I'm not just about writing code â€“ I'm about crafting code that is efficient, maintainable, and, dare I say, beautiful.
<br>
So, whether you're a fellow developer, a potential collaborator, or just someone curious to learn more, I'm excited to connect and explore the endless possibilities together. Let's build something great!
